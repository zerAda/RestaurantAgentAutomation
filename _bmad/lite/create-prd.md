# Condensed PRD Generator

> Single-prompt PRD generation for any AI platform. Combines BMAD-METHOD quality rules, project-type guidance, and domain requirements into one actionable reference.

## Instructions

1. Read the user's product brief (or ask them to describe their product)
2. Detect the **project type** and **domain** from the brief using the tables below
3. Apply the quality rules and generate a complete PRD
4. The PRD should be information-dense, measurable, and traceable

## PRD Structure (9 Required Sections)

### 1. Executive Summary
Vision, differentiator, target users. One paragraph max.

### 2. Success Criteria
Measurable outcomes using SMART criteria:
- **S**pecific: precisely defined
- **M**easurable: quantifiable with test criteria
- **A**ttainable: realistic within constraints
- **R**elevant: aligns with business objectives
- **T**raceable: links to source requirement

### 3. Product Scope
Define MVP, Growth, and Vision phases. What's in scope for each phase, what's explicitly out of scope.

### 4. User Journeys
Comprehensive coverage of how users interact with the product. Each journey should map to functional requirements.

### 5. Domain Requirements
Industry-specific compliance and regulatory requirements (if applicable). See Domain Guidance below.

### 6. Innovation Analysis
Competitive differentiation and novel approaches (if applicable).

### 7. Project-Type Requirements
Platform-specific and architecture-specific needs. See Project Type Guidance below.

### 8. Functional Requirements (FRs)
Capability contract. Each FR must be:
- A **capability**, not implementation ("Users can reset password via email" not "System sends JWT")
- **Measurable** with test criteria ("loads in under 2 seconds" not "fast")
- **Specific** with concrete quantities ("up to 100 concurrent users" not "multiple users")
- **Traceable** to a user journey or success criterion

**FR Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Subjective adjectives: "easy to use", "intuitive", "user-friendly", "fast", "responsive"
- Implementation leakage: technology names, specific libraries, implementation details
- Vague quantifiers: "multiple", "several", "various"
- Missing test criteria: "The system shall provide notifications" (when? how fast? to whom?)

### 9. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Quality attributes. Each NFR must follow this template:
> "The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]"

Examples:
- "API response time under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring"
- "99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA"
- "Support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing"

**NFR Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Unmeasurable claims: "The system shall be scalable" → specify scale target
- Missing context: "Response time under 1 second" → specify percentile, load conditions

## Quality Rules

### Information Density
Every sentence must carry information weight. Zero fluff.

**Replace:**
- "The system will allow users to..." → "Users can..."
- "It is important to note that..." → State the fact directly
- "In order to..." → "To..."

### Traceability Chain
```
Vision → Success Criteria → User Journeys → Functional Requirements
```
Every FR must trace back to a user need. Every success criterion must connect to the vision.

### Dual Audience
The PRD serves both humans (stakeholders review) and AI agents (downstream consumption for UX design, architecture, epics, and implementation). Use:
- Level 2 headings (`##`) for all main sections
- Consistent structure and patterns
- Precise, testable language

## Project Type Guidance

Detect the project type from the brief and apply the relevant guidance.

| Type | Detection Signals | Key Questions | Focus Sections | Skip Sections |
|------|------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| API/Backend | API, REST, GraphQL, backend, service, endpoints | Endpoints needed? Auth method? Rate limits? Versioning? | Endpoint specs, auth model, data schemas, error codes, rate limits | UX/UI, visual design, user journeys |
| Mobile App | iOS, Android, app, mobile | Native or cross-platform? Offline needed? Push notifications? Store compliance? | Platform reqs, device permissions, offline mode, push strategy, store compliance | Desktop features, CLI commands |

## Domain Guidance

Detect the domain from the brief and ensure mandatory requirements are included.

| Domain | Signals | Complexity | Key Concerns |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Healthcare | medical, clinical, FDA, patient, HIPAA, therapy | High | FDA approval, clinical validation, HIPAA compliance, patient safety, MFA, audit logging, PHI encryption |
| Fintech | payment, banking, trading, KYC, AML, transaction | High | PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails, fraud prevention |
| GovTech | government, federal, civic, public sector, citizen | High | NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency, procurement rules |
| EdTech | education, learning, student, teacher, LMS | Medium | COPPA/FERPA student privacy, accessibility, content moderation, age verification, curriculum standards |
| Aerospace | aircraft, spacecraft, aviation, drone, satellite | High | DO-178C compliance, safety certification, simulation accuracy, export controls (ITAR) |
| Automotive | vehicle, autonomous, ADAS, automotive, EV | High | ISO 26262 functional safety, V2X communication, real-time requirements, certification |
| Scientific | research, algorithm, simulation, ML, AI, data science | Medium | Reproducibility, validation methodology, statistical validity, computational resources |
| LegalTech | legal, law, contract, compliance, litigation | High | Legal ethics, bar regulations, data retention, attorney-client privilege, court integration |
| InsureTech | insurance, claims, underwriting, actuarial, policy | High | Insurance regulations by state, actuarial standards, fraud detection, regulatory reporting |

| Building Automation | BAS, BMS, HVAC, smart building, life safety | High | Life safety codes, building energy standards, multi-trade interoperability, commissioning |
| General | (no specific signals) | Low | Standard security, user experience, performance |

**Critical:** Missing domain-specific requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation. Always check the domain table and include applicable requirements.

- `##` headings for each of the 9 required sections
- Tables where appropriate (user journeys, requirements)
- Specific, measurable language throughout
- No filler words or conversational padding
- Domain requirements section populated based on detected domain
- Project-type specific sections included/skipped per guidance
